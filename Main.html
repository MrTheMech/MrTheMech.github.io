                    a business’s information assets. When an enterprise’s employees are cyber security aware, it means they understand what cyber threats are, the potential
                     impact a cyber-attack will have on their business and the steps required to reduce risk and prevent cyber-crime infiltrating their online workspace.</span>

                    <span style="background-color:#000000b3">             Creating a culture around cyber security awareness in the workplace doesn’t mean that you’ll be completely eradicating 
                        the risk of data theft or cyber-crime to your business. Malware has burgeoned, becoming more and more sophisticated as each new strand is developed, 
                        and we expect to see the evolution and growth of cyber-threats and malware to proliferate. It was reported that 123 new strains of malware were found everyday in 2005. 
                        During that year, 10,000 of those threats were new strains of malware. 11 years later, research had shown that every second, four new strains of malicious malware were
                         discovered in Q3 of 2016[4] - it’s crucial to highlight that these were the strains that cyber security companies had found and identified. As new strains of malware grow, 
                         enterprises need to ensure that they’re implementing the appropriate security measures, educating their employees and eliminating any weaknesses that make them vulnerable
                          to an attack. Human error is an egregious exploit that can lead to fines and severe business damage.</span>

            <h4> <p style="color:rgb(17, 186, 216);"> <span style="background-color:#000000b3">                colleagues need to understand the role they play in strengthening a business’s cyber security. In most cases, it 
                needs to be taken back to the very basics. Cyber-crime shows no signs of slowing down, and a cyber-attack has the potential to incapacitate an organisation. 
                Training your employees and making them aware is not only your best defence - it also shows you’re paving your way to a more GDPR compliant future. Should you find
                 your company has fallen victim to a cyber-attack, the ICO will look at the preventative measures you have put in place beforehand. It is crucial for businesses to
                  implement the most basic cyber security measures, and cyber security awareness for employees is one of themt</span>
